== Description ==
This plugin permits you to scale images up, as well as down, in the default Wordpress media editor.

**Scenario**
You have a site/blog with most content as 640x480 images (or whatever size you use). But now, for whatever reason, you want to add a 480x360 image to your site and you wish to upscale it to 640x480 so the size matches everything else and doesn't look out of place..

**Problem**
Using the default Wordpress media editor, you are only permitted to scale down images, not scale up. Without this plugin, your only options would be to edit the image externally (Photoshop, etc.), or figure out another solution using percentages.

**Solution**
Install & Activate this plugin! Now, using the default Wordpress media editor, you can upscale as well as downscale your images without any hassle!


A working and simple solution.


== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin from the Wordpress plugin repository, unzip and upload to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't see any options or settings after activating the plugin..? =
